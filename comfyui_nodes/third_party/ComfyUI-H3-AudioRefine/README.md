# ComfyUI-H3-AudioRefine

Audio-only refinement pass for MiniMax H3 packed AV latents.

Freeze the video stream of a sampled H3 latent (e.g. from a 4-step Turbo pass)
and run additional denoising steps on the audio stream only. The intended use
is Turbo-LoRA workflows where 4-step video is acceptable but 4-step audio is
not: pay for a few extra audio steps instead of raising the whole joint pass
to 8-20 steps.

For how the cache actually works internally -- the packed layout, the ComfyUI hooks, the
approximation, the cost model, and notes for modifying it -- see
[TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md).

Example output -- 1376x768, 10s, 4-step turbo pass natively, followed by 6 audio-only refinement steps with and without freezing the cache:

## Install

**ComfyUI Manager** (recommended): open Manager, search for `ComfyUI-H3-AudioRefine`,
click Install, restart ComfyUI.

**Manual**: clone into your `custom_nodes` directory and restart ComfyUI.

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Adudeguyman/ComfyUI-H3-AudioRefine.git
```

There are no Python dependencies to install -- the pack uses only torch, numpy, and
ComfyUI's own internals.

## How it works

ComfyUI's native MiniMax H3 support already contains a masked-inpaint path for
the packed AV latent (`MiniMaxH3.scale_latent_inpaint` /
`_denoise_mask_conds` in `comfy/model_base.py`), and the sampler accepts a
per-stream `noise_mask` as a NestedTensor. This pack builds that mask
(video = 0.0 preserve, audio = 1.0 generate) and runs a partial-denoise pass:

- Each step, the frozen video slice is injected at the visual cond timestep
  (0.999) -- the same treatment keyframe conditioning gets -- so the model
  denoises the audio *in the context of* the finished video.
- The sampler's final masked blend returns the video slice bit-identical to
  the input (at `video_denoise` 0.0).
- The audio stream rides ComfyUI's ModelSamplingAV carry, so its effective
  sigma stays on the trained dual-schedule relationship. No custom sampler.

**Compute expectation:** H3 is a single-stream transformer over one packed
token sequence. Frozen video tokens remain in the sequence as attention
context, so each audio refinement step still costs close to a full forward
pass. The saving is step arithmetic (4 turbo + 4-6 audio ~= 8-10 full-cost
steps vs 20), not per-step cost.

## Example workflow

![Wiring the refine pass with the frozen video cache](examples/workflow.png)

A ready-to-use graph is included:
[`example_workflow/mmh3_audio_refiner_basic_t2v.json`](example_workflow/mmh3_audio_refiner_basic_t2v.json)
-- drag it into ComfyUI. It uses a couple of common utility nodes (math expression,
resolution selector); if they show as missing, install them via ComfyUI Manager.

`SamplerCustomAdvanced` runs the turbo pass; its LATENT goes to `H3 Audio Refine
Sampler`, which takes its MODEL from `H3 Frozen Video Cache`. Note the refine branch
comes off the model *before* the turbo LoRA: pass 1 runs with the turbo LoRA, the
refinement runs without it, so the extra audio steps use the undistilled weights -- the
audio quality you were missing is exactly what the turbo LoRA took away. `positive` is
wired into `negative` as well: H3 is a distilled model that runs at cfg 1.0, so the
uncond branch is never evaluated and the negative input is unused. The clip at the top of
this README is the output of this graph.

### Measured

Three runs of the same graph, from the console (75,216 packed rows, 9.7 GB cache at
`hidden`/`int4` in system RAM):

| | steps | refinement pass | whole prompt |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turbo only, no refinement | 4 | -- | 137.3s |
| + refinement, frozen cache | 4 + 6 | 44.6s (26.5s build, then 3.6s/step) | 184.6s |
| + refinement, cache bypassed | 4 + 6 | 124.0s (20.7s/step) | 263.4s |

So on this machine: **5.7x per cached step** (20.7s -> 3.6s), **2.8x on the refinement
pass** as a whole once the build is counted, and **1.4x on the end-to-end job** -- 79
seconds saved on a 263-second render.

**Only the first refinement step builds the cache.** So you will notice that first step
taking an additional few seconds compared to a normal step (26.5s vs 20.7s), because the
cache is built AND the first audio denoise step is processed. Every step after it reads
the cache instead of recomputing, and drops to 3.6s (or longer depending on target
generation length). So a 6-step refinement is one 26.5s step followed by five at 3.6s,
not six expensive ones:

```
without cache   20.7 + 20.7 + 20.7 + 20.7 + 20.7 + 20.7  = 124.0s
with cache      26.5 +  3.6 +  3.6 +  3.6 +  3.6 +  3.6  =  44.6s
                 ^^^^ builds the cache
```

The more refinement steps you run, the more the one expensive step is diluted -- it pays
for itself after roughly 1.3 steps.

Worth noting too: refinement steps are *not* free without the cache. At 20.7s each
against 23.0s for a full turbo step, freezing the video saves almost nothing by itself,
because the frozen rows still run through every block. That gap is the entire reason this
cache exists.

The `verbose` log shows where the time goes -- on cached steps here, `block loop 3.59s`
of a `3.65s` model call, so essentially all of it is the transformer and almost none is
overhead.

**These numbers are from one machine and are not a promise.** They were measured on an
RTX 5090 (32 GB) with the cache in system RAM at `hidden`/`int4`, on one clip at one
resolution. Both the absolute times and the ratios will move with your GPU, your
resolution and frame count, where the cache ends up living (VRAM, RAM, or disk), and
whether the model itself fits in VRAM or is being streamed. On a setup where weight
streaming dominates the step, the saving will be much smaller than this table suggests --
the cache only removes compute, and it cannot help with time that is not being spent on
compute. Measure your own with `verbose` rather than working from these.

## Do I want the frozen cache?

Both paths produce the same kind of result. They differ in what they spend.

**Without the cache** (bypass the node, or just don't add it) the refinement pass is
resource-free -- no extra RAM, no extra VRAM, nothing on disk -- and it is exact, with no
approximation anywhere. The cost is time: because H3 packs video and audio into one
sequence with full bidirectional attention, every refinement step re-runs the entire video
stream through all 50 blocks even though the video is frozen and its output is discarded.
So each audio-only step costs about the same as a full generation step. Six refinement
steps costs roughly what six more generation steps would.

**With the cache**, the frozen rows' per-block state is computed once and reused, so later
steps only compute the audio rows. Refinement steps get substantially cheaper, at three
costs: a chunk of RAM/VRAM/disk to hold the cache (around 10 GB at `hidden`/`int4` for the clip
measured above, more at `kv` or lower compression, scaling with resolution and frame
count), a first refinement step at full price to build
it, and a mild approximation -- the frozen rows stop reacting to the evolving audio
between rebuilds (see `refresh_interval`).

Rough guidance:

- **Memory is tight.** Skip the cache. This is the real deciding question, not step count.
  A refinement pass without it is slower but costs nothing beyond what generation already
  uses, and it is exact.
- **You can spare the memory.** Use the cache from about 2 refinement steps upward. On the
  measurements above the build pays for itself after roughly 1.3 steps, so even short
  refinement runs come out ahead; longer ones come out far ahead.
- **Not sure whether it is helping.** Turn on `verbose` and compare a run with the node
  bypassed against one with it active. The per-step log tells you where the time went
  rather than leaving you to infer it.

## Nodes

### H3 Audio Refine Sampler (all-in-one)

Inputs: `model`, `positive`, `negative`, `latent` (the sampled AV latent),
`seed`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name` (default euler), `scheduler` (default
simple), `audio_denoise` (default 0.5), optional `video_denoise` (default 0.0).

Wire the first pass's sampler LATENT output straight into `latent`, reuse the
same model stack (including the Turbo LoRA) and conditioning, and take the
refined LATENT to your existing VAE decode nodes. `audio_denoise` controls how
far the audio is re-noised before refinement:

- 0.3-0.6: keep pass-1 audio content, clean up noise floor / artifacts.
- 1.0: regenerate the audio from scratch against the frozen video.

`steps` runs KSampler-style at that denoise depth (the schedule is
`steps / audio_denoise` long and only the tail executes).

### H3 Audio Refine Mask (composable)

Takes the sampled LATENT, attaches the freeze-video / generate-audio noise
mask, outputs LATENT. Feed it to a stock `SamplerCustomAdvanced` (with
`BasicScheduler` at `denoise` = desired audio re-noise depth) or a stock
`KSampler` with `denoise` < 1.0. Use this variant to control the refinement
schedule/guider yourself or to A/B against the all-in-one node.

Optional `video_denoise` > 0.0 partially opens the video stream to the
refinement pass instead of freezing it exactly.

## Suggested starting point (Turbo 4-step)

1. Pass 1: your existing 4-step Turbo graph, unchanged.
2. H3 Audio Refine Sampler: steps 4-6, audio_denoise 0.5, euler / simple, same
   conditioning as pass 1, and the model branched off *before* the Turbo LoRA.
3. Decode as usual.

A/B against a straight 6-8 step Turbo run at matched total step count -- that
is the honest baseline this approach has to beat.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI with native MiniMax H3 support including the AV masked path
  (0.33.x verified against master as of 2026-08-21; the per-stream
  denoise-mask handling in `CFGGuider.sample` and
  `MiniMaxH3.scale_latent_inpaint` must be present).
- No extra Python dependencies. No monkeypatching: only public
  `comfy.sample` / `noise_mask` APIs are used.

### Startup flags worth knowing about (NVIDIA)

If you are on ComfyUI 0.34 or newer and see `aimdo memory compile error`, update this
pack -- 1.0.3 handles it by disabling the model compiler for the refinement pass only.
`--disable-comfy-compiler` disables it globally, which is also worth trying if 0.34 made
your normal generation slower.

**There is a known CUDA driver bug in ComfyUI's dynamic VRAM streaming.** ComfyUI
maintainers have reported it to NVIDIA and documented two flags that work around it --
`--cuda-device 0` (or a higher index) to restrict ComfyUI to a single GPU, and
`--disable-pinned-memory`. See
[ComfyUI issue #15255](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/issues/15255).

They are listed there as alternatives, but they address different things and **running
both together works well** on a single-GPU machine:

```
python main.py --cuda-device 0 --disable-pinned-memory
```

Use `--disable-pinned-memory` on its own only if you need more than one GPU visible,
since `--cuda-device` hides the others.

OOM errors have been reported while using this pack that trace back to that bug rather
than to the cache. A refinement pass moves a lot of data between system RAM and the GPU,
which makes it a good way to run into it. **If you hit OOM here, try these flags before
assuming the cache is at fault** -- neither is required, and neither is specific to this
pack.

`--disable-pinned-memory`

ComfyUI normally uses *pinned* (page-locked) system memory to move model weights to the
GPU faster. Pinned pages cannot be swapped out by the OS, and allocating them is slow and
requires contiguous physical memory. On some setups that backfires: allocations fail or
crash inside CUDA even though there appears to be free memory, particularly at higher
resolutions or when system RAM is already committed. Users have hit this with WSL, GGUF
loaders and heavy VRAM offloading, and disabling the feature resolved it. Transfers get
somewhat slower, but the failures go away. This is also the workaround to use instead of
`--cuda-device` if you need more than one GPU visible.

`--cuda-device 0`

Restricts ComfyUI to a single GPU. Users report this improving memory behaviour **even on
single-GPU machines**. The likely reason: it makes that card the only *visible* device, so
nothing in the stack has to reason about other adapters -- integrated graphics, a headless
second adapter, or a container runtime -- when allocating and streaming. It also makes the
memory numbers in the logs unambiguous.

Harmless on a single-GPU box, and worth trying alongside `--disable-pinned-memory` if
refinement passes are crashing. On a multi-GPU machine, set the index of the card you
actually want rather than assuming `0`.

## Notes / limits

- Taking the refinement branch off the model **before** the Turbo LoRA is the
  recommended setup, and it is what the example workflow does. Pass 1 gets
  turbo's speed for the video; the refinement steps run on undistilled weights,
  so the audio quality the LoRA cost you is what the extra steps recover. This
  is not a risky configuration: the refine pass builds its own sigma schedule
  rather than continuing pass 1's, so the base model denoises from a
  partially-noised latent in the ordinary way, and the frozen video conditions
  it identically regardless of which weights produced it.
- `latent` must be a sampled H3 AV latent (nested video+audio). Plain latents
  are rejected with a clear error.
- Conditioning with keyframes/refs is passed through untouched; the frozen
  video mask stacks with them via the native pooled-mask path.

## Changelog

**1.0.4**
- Fix `NameError: name 't_call' is not defined` on every activated call with
  `verbose` enabled (1.0.3 only). The per-call timestamp was a local of one closure
  while the verbose summary that reads it lives in a sibling closure. Reported by
  @sethharris-cpu (issue #2). `verbose=False` was unaffected.

**1.0.3**
- The RAM backend now keeps the cache in pageable host memory instead of pinned. Pinned
  blocks are retained by PyTorch's caching host allocator for the life of the process and
  are not reused across rebuilds of differing shape, which leaked tens of GiB over a
  session. Thanks to @gabxav (PR #1).
- RAM sizing recalibrated for that change: the host footprint is now ~1.0x the packed
  cache (measured 20.6 GB packed -> 20.0 GB RSS), so the overhead factor drops from 1.5 to
  1.1. The old value made `auto` demand ~11 GB more than a 20 GB cache actually needs and
  refuse RAM unnecessarily. The build log now prints `actual/estimated` so the factor can
  be checked against your own runs.
- ComfyUI 0.34 compatibility: from 0.34 the DiT forward is recorded into an aimdo
  "malloc graph" by the Comfy model compiler, which assumes a repeatable allocation
  pattern. This cache is the opposite (a multi-GB build allocation, eviction requests
  mid-forward, a different shape again on cached steps), so it surfaced as
  `RuntimeError: aimdo memory compile error`. The node now switches the model compiler
  off for the duration of sampling on its own model -- the same thing
  `--disable-comfy-compiler` does globally -- and restores the setting afterwards,
  including on error. No effect on older ComfyUI, and a user-supplied
  `--disable-comfy-compiler` is left alone.
- New `free_after_pass` input (appended last; default off): release the cache when the
  sampling run ends instead of holding it for a possible warm re-queue.

**1.0.2**
- The node now asks comfy's `free_memory()` to make room before allocating the cache
  (VRAM working buffers + packed cache for the vram backend, RAM for the ram backend),
  so weights are evicted deliberately instead of colliding with an untracked allocation.
- Build log reports the full expected resident footprint (packed + working buffers), not
  just the packed size.
- RAM backend now requests comfy's pin budget (freeing comfy's own pinned staging) sized
  at a measured 1.5x overhead factor, and auto's RAM fit test uses the same factor.
- The VRAM room request is repeated on every cached step, not just at build, and the
  dequant working buffers are released between calls (~4 GB back to comfy's pool).
- New `vram_margin_gb` input (appended last; default 1.0): extra VRAM added to every
  room request, for when the estimate undershoots on a given clip.
- Backend selection and room requests now account for the transient activations of the
  step itself (the full-forward MLP intermediate at build time, ~8 GB at 75k rows), sized
  in fp32 to match what `int8_linear` actually allocates. `auto` no longer picks VRAM for
  a cache that fits on its own but leaves no room for the forward building it.
- VRAM frees now report device memory instead of host RSS.

- 1.0.0: Initial release. H3AudioRefineMask, H3AudioRefineSampler.

## H3 Frozen Video Cache

Accelerates the refinement pass. On the first refinement step it runs the model normally
while recording every block's post-rope attention K/V for the frozen rows (text, cond/ref,
video). On every later step it computes **only the audio rows** (~1% of the sequence),
attending against the cached K/V, instead of re-running ~37k video tokens through all 50
blocks.

**`enabled`** turns the cache off without rewiring: the model is returned completely
unpatched, no wrapper, no block patches, no memory allocated -- identical to bypassing the
node. Refinement then runs at full price per step. Use it to A/B a cached run against an
uncached one without touching the graph.

**Wiring:** place after your LoRA/patch stack, feed the patched MODEL into the refine
sampler (`H3 Audio Refine Sampler` or a stock sampler fed by `H3 Audio Refine Mask`).
The patch self-gates: it only activates when the model is called with the video stream
fully frozen and the audio stream still generating. On the first refinement step it logs
`building cache | rows=... size=... backend=...` to the console -- if you never see that
line, the cache is not engaging and the pass is running at stock speed. Pass-1 sampling, partial video masks, and audio-mask workflows
pass through the stock path bit-for-bit, so the same patched MODEL is safe to wire
anywhere.

**What it costs (honesty section):**
- This is an approximation: between rebuilds, the frozen rows stop reacting to the
  evolving audio. `refresh_interval N` rebuilds the cache every N steps (each rebuild is
  one full-price step) if you want to periodically re-open that feedback path. `0` =
  build once.
- The first refinement step is always full price — it builds the cache.
- Cached steps are not free: model weights still stream per step if your model is
  offloaded to RAM, and the cache itself streams from wherever it lives. Expect cached
  steps to cost roughly (weight streaming) + (cache transfer) + (tiny audio compute),
  not zero.
- The latent preview will show garbage video during cached refinement steps (video rows
  are not computed; the sampler's mask blend restores the real video in the output).
  The final latent is unaffected.

**Cache contents** (`cache_contents` input): the storage/compute dial.
- `hidden` (default) — stores each block's post-norm hidden states (5376/row) and rebuilds
  K/V on the fly each cached step. ~2.7x smaller than `kv`; cached steps keep ~30% of the
  per-block video matmul work (the qkv projection), so expect roughly ~3x faster refinement
  steps. This is the config that fits a RAM-starved box where the model offload pool
  already owns most of system memory.
- `kv` — stores post-rope K/V directly (14336/row). Cached steps are nearly compute-free,
  but you need the room to hold it.

**Backends** (`backend` input): where the cache lives.
- `auto` — picks the first of vram / ram / disk that fits with a 4 GB margin, and prints
  the choice and the reason to the console. It will only consider disk if `allow_disk` is
  on; otherwise it raises an error explaining what did not fit rather than falling back.
- `vram` / `ram` / `disk` — force a placement. Selecting `disk` without `allow_disk` is an
  error, not a silent downgrade. Disk caches live under the ComfyUI temp directory and are
  deleted when replaced.
- `allow_disk` — off by default. See the disk wear warning at the top of this README.
Cache size is printed on every build **before** allocation, and that log line is the
authoritative number. It scales **linearly with clip length and resolution**: at
1344×768 / 24fps, `hidden`/`int4` costs roughly **1 GB per second of clip** (135 KB per
packed row across the 50 blocks); `kv` is 2.7x that; `fp8` doubles and `bf16` quadruples
any cell. For one worked example -- a ~5.2s clip at 1344×768 (~38k rows):

| | `bf16` | `fp8` | `int4` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kv` | ~55 GB | ~27 GB | ~14 GB |
| `hidden` | ~21 GB | ~10.4 GB | ~5.3 GB |

Sizes scale linearly with row count.

**Other memory the cache uses** (not part of the number above):
- Working VRAM during cached steps: `kv` holds two full-sequence dequant buffers
  (~1.1 GB at full canvas); `hidden` holds one (~0.4 GB) plus the transient full-sequence
  qkv activation (~1.6 GB peak).
- The disk backend stages through two double-buffered pinned blocks (~0.5 GB RAM for
  `kv`/int4, ~0.2 GB for `hidden`/int4).
- The RAM backend uses pageable host memory, so a freed cache is actually returned to the
  OS (see the note on pinned-allocator retention below).

**Precision** (`precision` input): `int4` (group-128 symmetric; default — smallest and
fastest to stream), `fp8` (per-row scaled e4m3), `bf16` (exact). Verified cached-step
deviation on the test model, both contents modes: bf16 ~0, fp8 ~4e-4 relative, int4
~2e-3 relative — small against the approximation itself, and `hidden` does not amplify
quantization error through the rebuilt projection (measured 0.0022 vs 0.0020 for `kv`
at int4).

**Diagnosing a refinement pass** (`verbose` input): logs one line per model call:

```
cached step | blocks: 50 cached, 0 built, 0 stock (of 50) | block loop 2.1s | whole model call 15.4s | outside blocks 13.3s
```

Read it as follows. `0 of 50` blocks touched (plus a warning) means the block replacement
never ran and the cache cannot take effect at all. A high `block loop` time with 50 blocks
cached means the transformer is still the bottleneck and the cache is not saving what it
should. A small `block loop` next to a large `outside blocks` means the step's time is
being spent outside the transformer entirely -- patchify, text refiner, final layer, or
memory management -- in which case no amount of caching inside the blocks will help.

Every build also logs *why* it rebuilt (`no cache yet`, `video latent changed`,
`conditioning changed`, `layout changed`, `refresh_interval reached`). If you see a build
line on **every** step, the cache is never being reused and the pass is running slower
than stock -- the reason field says what is invalidating it.

**Coexisting with ComfyUI's memory manager:** the cache is not tracked by comfy's
accounting, so before allocating, the node asks `free_memory()` to clear the room it
needs -- comfy then evicts model weights deliberately instead of colliding with an
allocation it cannot see. This works on both sides: a VRAM request for the working
buffers (plus the packed cache on the `vram` backend), and on the `ram` backend a pin
budget request sized at ~1.5x the packed cache -- the measured real footprint of a pinned
host allocation, not the optimistic packed size -- which makes comfy free its own pinned
staged weights against actually-available RAM. The auto-backend fit test uses the same
1.5x figure, so `auto` no longer chooses RAM on headroom that would not survive the
allocation. The build log reports the packed cache size, the VRAM working
buffers on top of it, and the rough total resident footprint. The request is repeated on every
cached step (comfy's picture of free VRAM moves between our calls as weights stream back
in), and the dequant working buffers are released between calls so comfy's own
allocations can use that VRAM while a step is not running. If you still hit CUDA OOM
during refinement, raise `vram_margin_gb` on the node -- it is added to every room
request, making comfy evict more before the cache allocates. No launch flags needed.

**Why `auto` may refuse VRAM even when the cache would fit.** The cache has to coexist
with the transient activations of the step running alongside it. Those are large at high
row counts: the MLP intermediate alone is `rows x ffn*2` in fp32 -- about **8 GB at ~75k
rows** -- and the build step runs a full forward, so it pays that in full. A 10 GB cache
plus an 8 GB transient plus ~16 GB of resident int8 weights does not fit in 32 GB, so
`auto` picks `ram` instead and says so in the log. Forcing `backend: vram` at that size
will OOM inside the build.

**Measured vs estimated memory:** every build logs what it predicted against what it
actually cost:

```
cache built | estimated 9.7 GB | process RSS 21.3 GB -> 31.4 GB (+10.1 GB) | MemAvailable 18.2 GB -> 7.6 GB (-10.6 GB)
```

The pre-allocation estimate comes from `MemAvailable`, which is a kernel *guess* at what
could be reclaimed under pressure, not a measurement -- it counts reclaimable page cache
and slab, so it reads optimistically. `process RSS` is what the cache really cost. If
those two disagree badly on your machine, trust RSS.

The `ram` backend keeps the cache in **pageable** host memory, so freeing it actually
returns the memory to the OS. It previously used pinned (page-locked) memory for faster
transfers, but PyTorch's pinned-host caching allocator retains freed blocks for the life
of the process -- and since each rebuild at a different resolution or clip length asks for
different block sizes, those blocks are never reused either. That leaked tens of GiB
across a session. Pageable transfers are somewhat slower; predictable release is worth
more. (Fix contributed by @gabxav, PR #1.)

**`free_after_pass`** releases the cache the moment a sampling run ends rather than
holding it for the next one. Default off, which keeps the current behaviour: re-queueing
the *same* pass-1 latent then skips the rebuild. Note that a randomized seed invalidates
the cache anyway, so if you randomize between runs you are holding several GB between
generations for a warm start you will not get -- turn this on. The cost is one full-price
build step on every run. It hooks ComfyUI's `OUTER_SAMPLE` wrapper, so it also fires on
error and on interrupt, which is when releasing the memory matters most.

**Lifecycle:** the cache persists across queue runs on purpose (re-queueing the same
refine skips the rebuild) and is invalidated automatically by a new video latent (new
seed), a layout change, or eviction (2 slots max). Disk caches live under the ComfyUI
temp directory: stale directories are swept on the next build, orphans are cleared by
ComfyUI's own temp cleanup at startup, and an interrupted build is discarded rather than
left half-written (verified: a post-interrupt run rebuilds cleanly).

**Compatibility:** the cache reuses ComfyUI core's own kernels (fused RMSNorm+rope,
optimized attention, swiglu) so the build step reproduces the stock forward exactly
(verified bit-identical on CPU against core). Core internals are structurally checked at
patch time and per step; any mismatch falls back loudly to the exact path rather than
producing wrong output. If your attention backend cannot handle cross-length q/kv
(audio queries vs full-sequence keys), switch attention backends for the refine pass.
